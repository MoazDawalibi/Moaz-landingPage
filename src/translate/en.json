Additionally, I'm proficient in using additional tools such as Formik for form management, react-query for data fetching, and Zustand for state management. My expertise extends to working with TypeScript for type safety in large-scale projects. Furthermore, I have experience in integrating socket communication for real-time features. On the design side, I am adept at using Photoshop, Illustrator, and Adobe XD to bring design concepts to life. I also follow design patterns, particularly the SOLID principles, to ensure scalable and maintainable code"
